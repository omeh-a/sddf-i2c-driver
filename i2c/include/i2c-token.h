// i2c-token.h
// This file specifies the tokens used in the transport layer
// between the i2c server and driver. This is a lower level abstraction
// which is more closely aligned to how the hardware handles transactions.
//
// This file also specifies the structure of a token buffer between server/driver.

// This paradigm is based on the S905X3's I2C interface - it is a nice level of abstraction
// however that should be very pleasant to translate to other interfaces. I extend this by
// removing the need for separate read, write and token buffers allowing data to be stored in
// 1D buffers indexed by libsharedringbuffer
